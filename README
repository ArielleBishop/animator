Created in collaboration with Jamie Peterson for CS 3500 Object-Oriented Design

A simple animating interface! Takes a set of commands from a .txt file and can render in a few different ways:
'text' mode prints the output of each shape's keyframes to the console
'svg' mode exports the animation to a .svg
'visual' mode renders the animation in a window using Swing
'edit' mode renders a simple editing interface, allowing functionality for:
    - adding and removing shapes
    - adding and removing keyframes on pre-existing shapes
    - editing pre-existing keyframes to occur at new times, or have different properties
    - play, pause, resume, restart, toggle loop
    - increase or decrease frame rate
    - quickly scrub through the animation
    - export to a text or svg file after you're done editing

Supported shapes include rectangles and ellipses.
Supported properties include color, position, and scale.

Program arguments should be in the following format:
-in [input-filepath] -view [view-mode] -out [output-filepath] -speed [ticks per second]

-in:    the relative file location from src/cs3500/animator         [REQUIRED]
-view   one of: "text", "svg", "visual", "edit"                     [REQUIRED]
-out    the relative file location from the root of the project     [OPTIONAL]
-speed  an integer representing frames per second to render         [OPTIONAL: default=1]
